# IPFS Integrations tracking
Here we track the application in which we want to support IPFS.

## Submit applications
As a general rule of thumb, any application that can use web resources (http/https) is a potential candidate to integrate IPFS support into.
Create an issue in the issue tracker of this repository to let us know which application needs IPFS integration.

## Completed integrations
These integrations have been fully developed and merged in their upstream projects. A release might or might not have been made yet.
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) 5.1 will have IPFS support
* [MPV](https://mpv.io/)

## Pending integrations
* [cURL](https://curl.se/) WIP [PR](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/8805#issuecomment-1179758610)
